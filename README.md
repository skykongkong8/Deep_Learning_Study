First, I tried to make deep learning algorithmn without using external python packages like tensorflow, sklearn.
They are based on fundamental theories about deep learning alogrithmn and simple(?) mathematics written by my hand.

Secondly, I will make more efficient deep learning algorithmn using external python packages admitting that it is not only way more useful and easier to make it that way, but also it is more logical to pour my effort in other aspects, rather than striving to make everything from A-Z.
